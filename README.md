# Dashed Outline

*Filter > Dashed Outline* (de: *Gestrichelte Kontur*) is a Glyphs.app filter for creating a dashed outline around your glyphs:

## Installation

Dashed Outline is [available in the Glyphs&nbsp;3 Plugin Manager](glyphsapp3://showplugin/Dashed%20Outline). Click on the *Install* button next to it and restart Glyphs. The plug-in will appear in your *Filter* menu.

It was written for Glyphs&nbsp;3.1. It may work in earlier versions of the software but it is not tested and I cannot guarantee it.
